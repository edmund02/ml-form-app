<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is my very first React Native project (previously have ReactJS experience only). I have learnt and explored the difference between ReactJS and React Native such as ReactJS uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) to navigate from page to page while React Native uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). 

This React Native application is tested on android (basically my phone) only. It is not tested on any other devices such as tablet and iOS (because I do not own one of those devices). 

Besides, I am using [Expo](https://expo.io/) to run the project. It is extremely easy to set up and run the project with Expo.

### Built With

- React
- React Native
- React Native Paper (Material Design)
- React Navigation
- Redux
- Expo

2. While waiting for the installation process to complete. Download the Expo Go on your mobile.
   - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US)
   - [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

3. Start the application in development environment.
